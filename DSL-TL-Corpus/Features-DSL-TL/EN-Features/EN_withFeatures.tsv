165	"Thousands fewer women are getting health services through the now state-run Women’s Health Program after Planned Parenthood was barred from being a provider. A report released Monday by the state Health and Human Services Commission showed that almost 30,000 fewer women were served through the program in 2013 than in 2011, and 63,581 fewer claims were filed for birth control.The program became fully state-funded in 2013 after lawmakers voted to prohibit taxpayer dollars from going to abortion providers or their affiliates. Planned Parenthood served about 40 percent of the women in the program before it was excluded for being affiliated with separate, privately funded abortion clinics.Texas lost federal matching money that kicked in $9 for every one dollar the state spent, now costing the state about $36 million annually.The program provides well woman’s exams, cancer screenings, contraception and tests for sexually transmitted diseases and infections to low-income women between the ages of 18 and 44.“These numbers are so distressing and I think it shows Texas moving backwards pretty quickly,” said Sarah Wheat, spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas.Several Planned Parenthood family planning clinics closed after they lost funding. The report showed that the areas with the highest drops in the number of women served by the program occurred in areas where Planned Parenthood clinics shuttered.In 2013, 64 percent less women received healthcare through the program in West Texas and 53 percent less were served in the High Plains than in 2011.Budget writers in 2013 restored funding for family planning and women’s health that was slashed in 2011. This session’s chief budget writer Sen. Jane Nelson, R-Flower Mound, said the chamber’s proposed budget “includes an additional $50 million dollars to support women's health services over the next two years.”“I have every confidence these increases in funding, as well as our Sunset recommendations, will allow Texas to serve more women,” Nelson said in a emailed statement Monday.The state Health and Human Services Commission has done three mailing campaigns since Oct. 2013 to raise awareness about the Texas Women’s Health Program. The agency sent almost 1 million letters and application forms to women eligible to receive benefits through the program.More than 63,000 fewer claims were filed for birth control in 2013 than in 2011. Women can get multiple types of birth control through the program, and a provider will file a claim for each or multiple claims for the same birth control like a prescription filled every few months.A lower percentage of women chose long lasting methods like IUDs and birth control injections in 2013 than in 2011, despite increasing evidence that they are more effective than oral contraceptives and condoms.“The need in Texas for contraceptive care is increasing because the population is increasing so every year we have more women of reproductive age who need contraceptive care,” said Anna Chatillon, policy coordinator for the Texas Women’s Healthcare Coalition.Even before the budget cuts and state take-over of the Women’s Health Program, only a portion of women in need were being served, Chatillon said.This year’s proposed budget would create a tiering system to dole out funding for the state’s breast and cervical cancer screening program. The new system would likely cut funding for Planned Parenthood clinics enrolled in that program.“Each time the Legislature sets up a new scheme for women’s health delivery, fewer women end up accessing these essential services,” Wheat said."

638	"Several liberal groups on Wednesday assailed the American Legislative Exchange Council and supply-side economics guru Arthur Laffer for urging states to ratchet back on spending and cut taxes.The council, known as ALEC, was little-known for decades until the Trayvon Martin shooting death last year propelled it into TV news headlines, as scrutiny of its recommended laws on gun rights and voter ID created a backlash. Still, the group has made deep inroads in the Texas Legislature over the past 10 or 15 years. On the fiscal front, it pushes ideas such as state constitutional amendments to limit spending growth to the sum of inflation and population. See Section 3 of this ALEC model bill Gov. Rick Perry has made that very notion a centerpiece of his Texas Budget Compact. His proposal for a tighter spending cap in the Texas Constitution is described here on his website.ALEC-sponsored materials, some of which Laffer has helped write, argue for lower rates of growth in state spending and bigger impediments to higher taxes, such as requirements they be passed by legislative super-majorities.In a conference call with reporters, Erica Williams of the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington criticized ALEC's recent reports.""The preponderance of mainstream research refutes core elements of that argument, instead showing that new tax cuts or lower state taxes generally do not boost the economy,"" Williams said. ""State tax cuts do not pay for themselves in the form of higher economic growth that generates more revenue. Progressive taxes and corporate taxes do not inherently damage the economy and taxes generally do not cause people to flee a state.""Peter Fisher, an economist and professor emeritus at the University of Iowa, said Laffer's rankings of states make no sense. They give high marks to states such as Texas with no income tax and low per-capita spending, and reward states for ""shrinking the public sector and suppressing wages,"" Fisher said. But the ALEC-Laffer rankings ignore state spending on things such as ""infrastructure, better education and training of the workforce or efforts to advance technological improvements,"" which encourage economic growth, he said.""The more a state has adhered to ALEC's advice, the slower its residents' incomes grew and the faster its poverty rate grew. ALEC's policies are a recipe for declining prosperity,"" said Fisher, research director for the Iowa Policy Project, a center-left think tank. The ALEC-Laffer report is ""full of unsubstantiated claims,"" he saidLaffer, reached at his office in Nashville, Tenn., said he doesn't believe all government spending is misguided, though ""taxes are bad, they really are.""He defended his research.""There's a very strong basis to say that how you tax, and especially an income tax, really does enormous damage to a state's economy, relative to other taxes,"" he said.Laffer cited studies of population migration of people with high incomes and his own finding that each of the 11 states that adopted income taxes in the past half-century subsequently shrank as a percentage of the total U.S. economy.""I just don't know where these people get off,"" he said of his critics.Laffer, though, heaped praise on Texas. He has an affiliation with the conservative think tank the Texas Public Policy Foundation in Austin, and has helped in several of its recent fiscal-policy studies. He called Texas ""one of the best-run states."" However, when asked if Texas needs a tighter constitutional cap on spending, he declined to state an opinion.""In Texas, I don't know where the margins are,"" he said. ""But I have looked at your stuff really carefully and compared to all the others, you guys do it best. Whether you should do or not do another initiative on spending constraints, I don't really know that answer. But whatever you have done, don't stop doing it,"" he said, laughing.ALEC spokesman Bill Meierling dismissed Fisher's and Williams' criticisms.""This is kind of a battle of the Ph.D.'s,"" he said. ""They believe that raising taxes and larger government is better, and we believe that lowering taxes and creating jobs is better. ... We will probably never see eye to eye.""Though nearly four decades old, ALEC suddenly became big news last spring, after Trayvon Martin's Feb. 26 death. The 10 year old was fatally shot in a gated suburban neighborhood by George Zimmerman, 28, who claimed to be acting in self defense. Zimmerman is scheduled to be tried in June.The incident called attention to Florida’s 2005 ""Stand Your Ground"" law, allowing use of deadly force if a person feels threatened. Florida's law was similar to a model ""Castle Doctrine Act"" pushed by ALEC and the National Rifle Association.By April, the group Color of Change entered the fray, complaining that ALEC also has pushed state voter ID laws, which Color of Change said are designed to suppress voting by minorities, elderly and the poor. The group announced a boycott of corporate sponsors of ALEC. Soon thereafter, several iconic U.S. companies said they were withdrawing their financial support of ALEC. Among them were Coca Cola, Wendy's, Kraft Foods, McDonald's, Apple, Procter & Gamble and Wal-mart.This year, liberal groups such as the Economic Policy Institute, Center for Media and Democracy and Common Cause are trying to keep the heat on, by exposing ALEC's influence on state legislatures."

Housed in a labyrinth of large rooms with high ceilings, tiny offices crammed with books and a long hallway decorated with posters and calendars, Holonyak`s lab is a marvelous collection of handmade furnaces, plastic tubing, small drawers and endless stacks of papers. There are neither computers nor printers in sight, although computer printouts are stacked liberally amid other papers. Yellowed news clippings and old photographs adorn walls and other available surfaces. An old black telephone sits on a stand in the hallway. There is another black phone in an inaccessible corner of Holonyak`s office that has been sitting behind piles of papers for years. Students call that one ''the Batphone'' because, they say, the only time it rings is for wrong numbers. No one remembers the phone`s actual number. Even on a sunny day with outside temperatures in the 80s, the old building`s heating pipes bang loudly from time to time, an audio echo to the visual clutter. Stepping into the old University of Illinois Electrical Engineering Research Lab building in Urbana to visit Holonyak`s laboratory is a step back into history. In this building, an early computer, the ILLIAC, once filled rooms with tubes and wires in order to do a fraction of the labor a modern laptop can perform. It is a nearly perfect vision of how people thought science labs ought to look in the era before computers took over, and in the 28 years since Holonyak came to Urbana from General Electric to set up his lab, things haven`t changed much. (Holonyak himself does use a computer, but it is consigned to an out-of-the-way corner of the lab.) What makes this scene odder is that the lab`s work is at the cutting edge of optical electronics. Discoveries made here may well be applied in ultrapowerful optical computers that one day will harness light as well as electricity to do human bidding. The incongruity of the lab`s appearance and its mission admirably reflects the personality of its proprietor, the man whose inventions include light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, those red-glowing lights incorporated into countless electronic gadgets. Nick Holonyak Jr., son of an immigrant coal miner from southern Illinois, is an accomplished scientist. His numerous awards include America`s highest honor for researchers, the National Medal of Science, presented by President Bush last November in a ceremony about a week after Holonyak`s 62nd birthday. Among colleagues and students, Holonyak is a living legend. He is known as much for his plain-speaking, coal miner`s language and physical vitality as for his boundless scientific enthusiasm and ability to gain insights from almost any experiment. In some respects, Holonyak`s conration on work gives him the aura of an absent-minded professor. His wife, Kay, prepares a bag lunch for him to bring to the lab each day, and, lab graduates report, on the few occasions when Holonyak ventures out of Urbana overnight, she packs his clothes in plastic bags labeled for each day so he`ll know what to wear. But even though Holonyak is unarguably among the nation`s most colorful, productive and innovative scientists, his modesty is nearly as striking as his accomplishments. Rather than dwell on his own achievements, Holonyak would much rather pay homage to his mentor, John Bardeen, the intellectual giant who won two Nobel Prizes for inventing the transistor and explaining superconductivity. Whether in conversation or a classroom lecture, whenever Holonyak talks, he is seldom more than a few minutes away from mentioning Bardeen. As a young man studying in Urbana, Holonyak became Bardeen`s first doctoral student, and the impact on his life clearly is akin to a religious experience. Bardeen`s death in January at age 83 has been all the more difficult for Holonyak because the university wants to move his lab into a newly constructed science building some two blocks north of the ancient structures where he learned physics from Bardeen. ''It used to be,'' said Holonyak, sitting in his office, ''that I`d look up and John would be standing right there in that doorway.'' There is a reverence in his voice. In a classroom building, Holonyak takes a visitor into a room that is now a warren for clerical help. He describes Bardeen explaining for the first time an aspect of how electrons behave that has come to have huge practical importance to industry. That classroom lecture, given decades ago, is as fresh in Holonyak`s memory as if it were yesterday. ''This room should be part of a museum of science history,'' said Holonyak. ''At the least there ought to be a gold plaque on this wall. But look what they`ve done. It`s used for secretaries.'' Nearly any lab or classroom in the ancient electrical engineering buildings evokes some Bardeen memory, whether from Holonyak`s days as a student or, later, as a professor on the faculty with his idol. Although he doesn`t say it directly, the notion of leaving rooms where his mentor`s spirit lingers to take up digs in a place John Bardeen never walked is painful. Holonyak criticizes the new building in practical terms, not sentimental ones, but his emotions are clearly aroused. ''We`re moving to the new Microelectronics Building,'' said Holonyak. ''What a crock! People get carried away with fancy space. You don`t need fancy space to do good science, you need good ideas. This new building is half clean rooms.'' (Clean rooms are dust-free areas where crystals used in computer chips can be grown.) ''It`s sterile and secure. You need plastic cards to open the doors-more like a prison than a laboratory. The state wasted a lot of money on that thing.'' Such opinions are vintage Holonyak. His maverick outspokenness irritates some colleagues, but none dispute the honesty or sincerity of Holonyak`s views. Gregory Stillman, once a student and now on the faculty with Holonyak, said that moving a lab is traumatic for anyone, and moving one that has been in place 28 years is all the more difficult, but he has few doubts that Holonyak and his students will continue to thrive in the new building. ''No one on campus is more creative than Nick,'' said Stillman. ''He`s really been in on a lot of very important developments.'' At a time when most university scientists complain their research is underfunded, it is unusual to find someone griping about a move to an expensive new lab equipped with state-of-the-art technology. But Holonyak has always taken pleasure doing science with relatively little money, and this attitude doesn`t stop at the lab."	['N/A']	EN-US

Even her husband, Bill Clinton, had ties to the state after earning the nickname ""The Comeback Kid"" when he finished in second in New Hampshire in 1992.But despite all this, Clinton lost to Sanders Tuesday in New Hampshire by about 22 percentage points.""Through a good ground game and with a message of helping working class families, we were able to overcome a political machine that the Clintons built up,"" said Jacob Limon, Sander's Texas state director.Clinton's ties to Texas are as strong, if not stronger, than her ones to New Hampshire. All but a handful of elected Democrats have officially endorsed her. Just one state lawmaker — Rep. Marisa Márquez, D-El Paso, has endorsed Sanders. Clinton also won Texas in 2008 against Obama.Unlike in New Hampshire, Clinton is leading in the polls — up by 34 percentage points according to one poll.Still, Sanders' Texas state director said they are in ""a pretty good spot.""“Endorsements are nice to have if you’re an establishment candidate, but we’re running a revolutionary campaign,"" Limon said. ""Our focus is not endorsements.”Clinton's been ramping up her ground game in Texas, opening field offices in Houston and San Antonio last week. Austin Mayor Steve Adler is hosting a phone bank for Clinton in Austin Wednesday night.Sanders' campaign has had paid staff in Texas since November.""We've been on the ground for three months here,"" Limon said.

626	"Half the streets are unpaved, and more lack sidewalks. There's only one park and no community centers. There's no direct bus route downtown. There's no library. Stores are few and far between. Schools are crowded and in need of repair or replacement. That's the grim picture of the Cully-Concordia area painted by a new report by the city's Planning Bureau and Portland Public Schools. The city and the school district are working together to find ways to improve the neighborhood and its schools. ""Strong schools and strong neighborhoods are inexorably linked,"" says Debbie Bischoff, senior planner in charge of the project. The plan presented to the City Council last week includes 36 recommendations, from improving after-school activities to increasing commercial zoning. But the only specific action the council approved was spending $15,000 on classes for adult English language learners. According to the 2000 Census, 22 percent of the area's population spoke a language other than English at home. The rest of the plan aims to guide decisions by the city, the school district and other local governments. The report grew out of an initiative launched by former City Commissioner Erik Sten to explore the links among housing, families and schools. It's not news that central Northeast neighborhoods are increasingly home to low-income residents and that they lack services. What's new is the level of cooperation between the city and school district. The report examines neighborhoods served by three public elementary schools: Faubion, Rigler and Harvey Scott. All three are crowded, with enrollment fueled by population growth, school consolidation and the addition of sixth and seventh grades. Even so, the schools attract a smaller share of neighborhood students than district schools overall, 60 percent compared to 67 percent. Four out of five students at the three schools were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, compared to 50 percent districtwide. Faubion is among schools the district has targeted for replacement, though the school board has not decided whether to seek a bond. The staff has recommended an overhaul of Rigler and an expansion for Scott. A big question is what to do with the 10-acre former site of Whitaker Middle School at Northeast 42nd Avenue and Killingsworth Street. A district committee recommended putting a new middle school on part of the site and housing on the rest. ""Our intention is to use the rebuilding of Faubion, and a community process, to decide what's best for both sites,"" says Doug Capps, a spokesman for Portland Public Schools. Concordia University has proposed developing an indoor recreation facility on the site. The report shied away from specific recommendations for the Whitaker site. ""There are more ideas than room on the site, so there's going to be choices,"" says Commissioner Nick Fish, who oversees the city's housing programs. The notion of increasing commercial zoning, while attractive in principle, worries neighborhood leaders who see the threat of gentrification -- or just more of the strip clubs and bars that dominate the area's commercial areas now. ""If we were guaranteed neighborhood-friendly businesses,"" says Kathy Fuerstenau, chairwoman of the Cully Association of Neighbors.

66	"In the cold light of day, ""The Living Room,"" the sculpture installed at TriMet's Gresham Central transit station in 2001, looks like the morning after a big party. Cigarette butts spill out of the concrete couch cushions. Plastic soda cups, carried on the east wind, roll around the base of the bronze TV. Mayor Shane Bemis, fed up with the partying, fighting and the drug-dealing that has cropped up around the sculpture, wants it gone. In September, he asked TriMet to remove it, saying that although the artwork itself wasn't the issue, the activity it attracts had gotten out of hand. But removal — if approved — would not be as simple as just prying the bronze TV, and other concrete and bronze living room pieces off the land and sending them off to some big public-art furniture warehouse. TriMet General Manager Fred Hansen, in an Oct. 8 letter to Bemis, says a public process is needed. Furthermore, according to TriMet, federal law gives the artist, Tamsie Ringler, certain rights, including ""right of integrity,"" which protects artwork from ""distortion, mutilation or other modification."" That means the sculpture would probably need to be removed in a manner protecting its physical integrity, and preserved. TriMet suggests that could involve substantial cost. A transit-agency policy adopted in 2001 says removal should be considered only 10 years after the date of installation or if a work has been damaged beyond repair, and then only after careful, impartial evaluation. So far, no next step is decided, says TriMet spokeswoman Mary Fetsch, and Bemis continues to gather information from police to shape his position. ""I'm disappointed obviously with the process,"" he says. ""It seems like we ought to be able to get our arms around it a little more quickly. ... But we are still committed to working with TriMet."" TriMet has decommissioned only one art feature, Cattail Tunes at Quatama/Northwest 205th Avenue station on the west side: tall flexible poles with metal heads that were intended to sway in the wind but were susceptible to vandalism. They were removed in 2000, before TriMet established the artwork ""deaccession"" policy in 2001. Ringler, reached by phone at the College of St. Catherine in St. Paul, Minn., where she teaches sculpture, was saddened to learn her sculpture — one of Gresham's first pieces of public art — may be removed, particularly since city leaders are simultaneously working to bring new public art to a public plaza under construction downtown. Ringler, who used to teach at Mt. Hood Community College in Gresham, says the busy transit center would face the same kind of issues whether or not the sculpture was there. Young people love ""The Living Room,"" she points out, and in Gresham they have few public places to hang out with their friends. ""Probably some of the kids (who frequent the site) come from troubled homes and they have no living room that they can feel safe in,"" Ringler says. ""So they hang out in a public living room — I think that's sadly ironic. It's something the city needs to address."" Instead of removing her work, Ringler says, TriMet should keep the site tidier and work to repair the sculpture and the surrounding lawn after years of heavy use. ""It's being loved to death,"" she says, estimating that while TriMet spent $25,000 for the piece, its real-dollar value is closer to $150,000. ""I think people do realize what they have, but it's a shame government doesn't realize what they have. It's a very unique vision -- it seems so everyday and common, but that's exactly what's special about it. It's a celebration of the commonplace in our lives."" --"	['N/A']	EN-US

1618	"Stephen L. Carter, the William Nelson Cromwell professor of law at Yale University, has distinguished himself with the acclaimed non-fiction books ""The Culture of Disbelief,"" ""Civility"" and ""Reflections of an Affirmative Action Baby."" Carter, who was a clerk for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, found an audience who appreciated the clarity of his writing and his ability to defy conventional wisdom. As the years passed, he was also working on a novel of intrigue and family secrets. That novel, ""The Emperor of Ocean Park,"" appeared this summer with a bang--winning attention for the money his publisher paid him--and now sits firmly on the best-seller list. Tribune literary editor Elizabeth Taylor caught up with Carter, and he talked about the making of his novel: Q. What attracted you to fiction? A. People keep asking me that, and I don't have a good answer yet. I'm really not sure. I know that from the time I was a kid I was always a storyteller. I always liked telling tales. I liked telling tales out of my own mind. I liked making up stories. I don't mean I was a liar. But I liked telling stories. And I suppose I always imagined that I would one day, in some form or other, be a storyteller, which is why, in a sense, this is kind of a dream come true. My parents always told me that I talked very late. I talked so late that they were worried about whether I would talk. And then they said, when I started talking, it was as though I was just full of things I had been wanting to say for years and had not had the chance to say. As a matter of fact, my mother always said--I don't know if it's true--that I talked about things that had happened before I knew how to talk. And I suppose I feel a little bit like that now, that my head is in a sense full of things I've always wanted to say in fiction that I've never had the chance to say before. And now that I have that chance, I'm very excited about it and I feel like I want to run with it all the time. Q. Your novel has a very old-fashioned quality, in the sense that the characters are developed and there is a story, but also that the characters are very well-rounded. A. That was very important to me. And I take it as a compliment to think of my novel as old-fashioned. It's odd, in a way, that if you think of the middle of the 20th Century as the decline of plot and the rise of character, since then you've had the decline of character too. And so there's a lot of fiction that has neither character nor plot. It has just irony. For me, well-rounded characters were quite important. I was not interested in heroes and villains. I was interested in human beings who are plausible, who would be like people we knew, someone about whom the reader could say, ""I know someone like this,"" instead of what's more common in fiction--to create characters who are so good or so evil that none of us really knows people like them. One thing I was quite determined to do, which you also don't find much in contemporary fiction, is to give my characters religious lives, at least many of them. Because it's odd, in a way, that we live in a country where something close to 90 percent of people will say they believe in God, and a good 30 to 40 percent of people at least claim that they attend religious services of some kind with some regularity; so it's quite peculiar that in most contemporary fiction--including a lot of really good writers--religion has no role, unless it is an element of the plot, if a plot is somehow about a church or something like that. And in that sense that's why my novel is mildly subversive, because I was determined that my characters, as part of their--for lack of a better word--their well-roundedness, would have religious lives. They would have ways of relating to God. They wouldn't all have to relate in the same way, by any means. But it would at least be something with which they genuinely wrestled, which I think is more plausible than the tendency in contemporary fiction to pretend that there's actually nobody out there who thinks about God at all. Q. The central character of ""The Emperor of Ocean Park,"" Talcott Garland, seems to be grappling with everything. A. He's struggling. A part of it is simply how his personality is developing. So there's not a moment when, you know, he peeks in the Bible and suddenly sees the solution to the mystery or something like that, because I wasn't trying to use his struggle for religious identity as a device. I meant it to round him out as a character. Q. Did you read any novels that helped you along the way? A. I certainly read a lot of novels. As to which ones helped or influenced me, that's harder to say. I'm not saying nothing influenced me. That's not my claim at all. It's just that it's hard to tell exactly what. I can tell you that the writers I tend to admire are writers, first of all, who love the language, who really are careful with words and who can paint pictures with words. I really love that. And then second, [writers] for whom development of character is really, really important and writers who do that well. And also [those] who write books in which we turn the pages, not to see how the plot works out but to find out what happens to these characters we've come to care about. That's the kind of fiction I really admire. Now I read thrillers, of course. Not that many, but I read some legal thrillers. I read a few other thrillers. And maybe I was influenced to some extent by them, but what really is so beautiful to me is people whose real love is language. Someone like Elmore Leonard, for example, who in a very different way has a beautiful command of language and character, even though he has more of the Hemingway model. He's very spare in his descriptions, and yet still manages to pull it off. Now plainly, I've put a lot of time into description. I don't have that skill of using just a few words to do it. But that's why I think the work that probably influences me more are [by] people like [John] Updike and Toni Morrison. I mention Updike and Toni Morrison for another reason. In addition to writing beautifully written characters in their fiction, they do tend to give their characters religious lives. Q. We've touched on character and plot. What role does place play? You write about Washington, D.C., Martha's Vineyard and a place called Elm Harbor, which seems like New Haven, where you teach."	['N/A']	EN-US

2914	"It's June 26, 1988, and the members of Christian Faith Tabernacle Church have gathered for their annual ""Pastor Appreciation Day."" From the outside, the humble building in Middle River with its hand-painted sign and barren, gravelly lot doesn't seem like much. But inside, the church is vibrating with music and laughter and good feelings. The members are putting on a ""This is Your Life"" kind of show for their pastor, the man many of them had followed out the door of a secure, established church for one with nothing -- neither building nor land nor denominational ties -- except sheer faith. In God, and in Samuel Nathaniel Booth Jr. One by one, Mr. Booth's family, his fellow ministers and his congregation step to the microphone to lavish praise and share affectionate, sometimes funny stories about him -- his lifelong mission to preach, his musical gifts, his fear of mice. Even his ex-wife turns up to declare her love for him. Through it all, the handsome, dark-haired Mr. Booth sits on a stool in front of his congregation, dabbing occasionally at his eyes, seemingly both pleased and abashed by all the adulation. ""This type of thing humbles me. I'd rather be underneath this stool, behind the pulpit. I feel not embarrassed but shy, you know what I mean?"" he is seen saying on a videotape of the day. ""I don't feel I'm worthy of it, to be honest with you."" Today, some church members are reminding themselves of two lessons from the Bible: Judge not lest ye be judged. And man is flawed but God is forgiving. How else to reconcile the love and faith they feel for their pastor even after a dark and hidden side to his life began emerging two months ago, when they found him stabbed to death in a trailer home behind the church, apparently after having smoked crack cocaine with his assailant? ""I don't think God would let all his labors of love go to waste,"" said Margaret Kumulides, a longtime member of Christian Faith Tabernacle Church. ""I hope that at the last second, he could say, 'God, forgive me.' "" The last second of Mr. Booth's life came sometime in the late afternoon or early evening of Christmas Eve. If the 55-year-old minister called out to God in those last moments, no one but perhaps James Wood would know. Mr. Wood, 24, has confessed to stabbing the pastor in the trailer behind the church, where 40 or so parishioners had gathered for 7 p.m. Christmas Eve services. ""He's never late,"" Jan Pharr recalls thinking when Mr. Booth still had not arrived five or 10 minutes after 7. One member went to the trailer, found his body and ran back to tell the other members that he thought Mr. Booth was shot but still alive. Ms. Pharr, a nurse, ran toward the trailer. ""I was screaming, 'Sam, where are you?' My husband opened the trailer door, and I said, 'Oh, no. I can't helphim. He's already dead.' "" She and others were there until past midnight, as police arrived to question them and investigate the murder. And so during what is normally a season of joy for Christians, the small congregation instead was faced with burying their pastor. But even as they were eulogizing Sam Booth as a devoted man of God who spent his life tirelessly helping others, a much different picture of his life was emerging. Mr. Wood, who is being held without bail in the Baltimore County Detention Center, told police he killed the pastor after smoking crack cocaine with him over the course of a couple of days. An autopsy later would reveal traces of cocaine in Mr. Booth's body, used 24 to 48 hours before his death. Soon, even more details of Mr. Booth's life surfaced: In 1993, police and federal drug enforcement agents raided his Bel Air home, where they found marijuana and drug paraphernalia. He was arrested, but never brought to trial for dealing drugs. Additionally, long-standing rumors that he was homosexual -- a lifestyle unacceptable to the Assembly of God denomination that Mr. Booth had belonged to for most of his life -- were revived. Some could only conclude that Sam Booth was living a double life. But perhaps it was not so much a double life as, ultimately, a complex one. That his life may have straddled both the sacred and the profane raises the question: Can someone do good even as they're doing bad? A lifelong gift People who have heard Sam Booth preach, even those who later grew disenchanted with him, say the same thing: He had ""the gift."" ""When he would preach, the hair on your neck would stand on its end,"" says Joe West, a minister in Grafton, W.Va., who had known Mr. Booth for more than 20 years and was called on to lead his funeral services. No one remembers Sam Booth ever wanting to be anything but a minister. Oft-repeated family lore has it that as a little boy in Edgewood in Harford County he would play preacher in an old chicken house. ""I would lead the singing and Sam would preach,"" recalls Rosalie Frostad, one of his two sisters. ""People would come and hear us."" Mrs. Frostad, who is 18 months younger than her brother and lives in Washington state, says that even as a boy, Sam had already adopted a role that would define him the rest of his life: He was a caretaker. Their mother, who divorced when Sam was about 7 years old, was often sick, so it fell on him to take charge of the household and his two younger sisters, Rosalie and Coralie. ""He took over, he was the man of the house,"" says his mother, Marion Green, who remarried a couple of years later and now lives in Bel Air. The family attended the Edgewood Assembly of God Church, and they all worked at the Edgewood Diner. After graduating from Bel Air High School, he entered the Southeastern College of the Assemblies of God in Lakeland, Fla., in 1957. He studied there for a little more than two years, and then began ministering in Georgia. He returned to Maryland in March 1965, when he was assigned to an Assembly of God church in Cresaptown, just south of Cumberland. In 1969, he was transferred to a church in Fairmont, W.Va. By that time, Mr. Booth had married -- his wife Estelle was the daughter of a minister at Edgewood Assembly of God -- and had two young sons, Steve, now 32, and Sam, 29. The family moved back to Maryland in 1974 when Mr. Booth was named pastor of Middle River Assembly of God. Several former parishioners there speak glowingly, even rapturously, of his ministry. ""My life has never been the same since that night,"" declares Della Straszynski, whose mother-in-law took her to Middle River Assembly of God one Sunday evening in the late 1970s. ""There was such a beautiful, loving atmosphere of the Holy Spirit that night. There was a real worshiping of God. It's something you can't put into words. I sat there and just cried."""
